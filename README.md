# ABAP-GlobalToLocal
Pack global ABAP classes in a single report - Simplifies distribution of complex codings.
I am a spin off from the SAP2Moose project.

You may also check how the same problem is solved in abapGit.

Use me if you want to program with global classes and still be able to distribute only a single program.
Unit Tests are not part of the generated program.
TEST-SEAM statements are cut out.
